# Rekt

Rekt is a library intended for use in [harmony hid][1] to assist with arranging and
re-arranging multiple displays on seperate machines into a single virtual screen space

It provides a simple api for handling how `Sets` (groups) of `Rectangles` interact with eachother
in a 2d space

## Performance
Rekt has been built for a specific use case where performance is not a particular concern.  
Although i do not believe it to be horribly ineficient no real effort has been put into efficiency,
there are certainly areas where clarity and expediency has been chosen over efficiency
